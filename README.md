## hi reader

here i will be exploring haptic motion  

it started with sword art online,  

## exploring haptic motion: from sao to haptic suits  

it all began with sword art online (sao), where immersive virtual reality (vr) experiences blurred the lines between reality and digital worlds. in sao, players are trapped inside a vr game, but the experience is heightened with the use of full-body haptic feedback. this concept sparked my interest in how vr headsets could become more than just visual experiences. it pushed the idea of integrating augmented reality (ar) with brain-computer interfaces (bcis) to unlock new possibilities for human interaction in virtual spaces.  

## the vision: brain-computer interfaces and ar integration  

as technology advances, the potential of brain-computer interfaces combined with ar could allow users to control virtual elements with their thoughts while receiving sensory feedback in real-time. this fusion could enhance experiences, allowing for intuitive interactions with the virtual world.  

## end goal: haptic motion suits  

the ultimate goal of this exploration is to integrate these technologies into fully functional haptic motion suits. these suits would provide users with tactile feedback that simulates the sensation of touch and movement within a virtual environment, revolutionizing immersive experiences.  

## the journey: building from the ground up  

to achieve this, i’ll begin by exploring the basic building blocks of vr and haptic technology, one step at a time. from understanding the sensors and hardware that enable tactile feedback to studying the software that powers ar and bcis, i'll break everything down and build from the foundation.  

## unity and 3d models: back to the kitchen  

once the pieces come together, i’ll be back home to cook up something extraordinary in unity. using 3d models, i’ll create and refine virtual environments, adding in the necessary integrations for haptic feedback and bci interaction. this will be the stage where everything converges, and the dream of seamless integration between mind, body, and digital space takes shape.
